## Origin

The motivation for this project was simple. My son played high school hockey for three years in upstate New York for the Shenendehowa Plainsmen. I was asked by the booster club to print a small roster with the player's names, year, and, more importantly, their numbers so that fans could easily identify them on the ice. First year, I just did an HTML page and had it printed by a colleague who has his own high end printer and lamination machines. Second year, I went a little further and did an online roster that fans could hit with their mobile devices. This is the result. 

## Nature of the application

This is progressive web app that runs and looks great on most, if not, all mobile devices (iPhones, android phones, ipads, etc).

## Environment

This project was built for and is hosted on netlify, an awesome cloud-based development platform. Simply click on the link in a browser https://shenhockey.netlify.app/ and you can download it right to your device (it gets an icon right on your home page).


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
